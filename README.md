# Git-commit-bot for Windows
A git commit generator that can commit repositories to boost your profile contributions.

It is a fairly simple and efficient script that works by renaming a single empty text file and commiting the changes. 
Feel free to test it for yourself.

## Requirements:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)

## How To Install:
To run the script, enter the following commands into the console:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/devanshds/Git-commit-bot.git
cd Git-commit-bot
python commitbot.py
```

The script will be executed

## Usage:
The script needs two parameters to run correctly: Repository name & Repository URL
- Create an empty repository beforehand without `README.md`.
- Make sure the repository name is the same as the empty repository you created before running the script.
- You may be asked for username and password.
- And within minutes you will have more commits than you had before.
  
The repository will come out looking like this so might wanna make it private

## Notes:
- I made this purely for learning purposes and out of curiosity. 
- You can extend its functionality to linux if you have experience with shell.
- For the curious souls, I myself, am not using this.
